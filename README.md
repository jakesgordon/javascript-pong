Canvas Pong
===========

This is a small experiment to implement a version of the classic Pong game in an HTML <canvas>.

 * You can find the [game here](https://jakesgordon.com/games/pong/)
 * You can find out [how it works](https://jakesgordon.com/writing/javascript-pong/)

You can also play this game in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omimkinlomnncbmnceacpkmlbfaapojj?hl=en-US)


NOTES
=====

 * No support for mobile devices (need to handle touch events instead of key input)
